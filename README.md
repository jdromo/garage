# Garage

Welcome to the Garage. This is the demo project for the SXSW 2017 workshop: What JavaScript Everywhere Really Looks Like.

This repository includes the backend Node service that controls the garage and keeps track of its state, as well as the control clients for web, iOS, Android, and desktop.

*The API must be running to use any of the control clients.*

## Dependencies

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v7 or newer)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) (Windows users may try to use [the Windows port](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releases).)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

(If you don't have Node, Redis, or Yarn, and can't successfully download them, we have some binaries and installers available on USB drives.)

Install Node and Redis. After Node is installed, install Yarn by running `npm install -g yarn` or by choosing any of the other [recommended Yarn installation methods](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-tab).

If you run into issues using Yarn, double check that your PATH is correctly [configured for Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#alternatives-tab).

## Running the API

### Setup

```
cp .env.example .env
yarn install
```

### Start

```
yarn start
```

This single command will start a Redis server, the Node API server, and the Node worker.

## Running the Web Client

### Setup

```
cd clients/web
yarn install
```

### Start

```
cd clients/web
yarn start
```

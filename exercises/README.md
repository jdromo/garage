# JavaScript Everywhere: In three parts

Welcome. We've setup three exercises to fill your time during the
workshop. Each increases in involvement, from browsing an existing
project, making changes to it, and re-working it to support additional
platforms.

## Before you begin

These examples are setup to run against a local version of the
API. First get that up and running:

```bash
cd <path/to/garage>
yarn install
yarn start
```

Checkout the [installation docs for yarn](yarnpkg.com/en/docs/) if you
do not already have it.

## Lesson 1: Investigation

This exercise is a high level overview of an existing cross-platform
application. We'll walk through the setup, some important aspects of
deploying to multiple platforms, and cover some of the tools involved
in this approach.

## Lesson 2: Changing

In this example, we'll make some modifications the project covered in
lesson 1. The goal of this lesson is to become familiar enough with
the code to prepare for lesson 3.

## Lesson 3: Creation

In this lesson, we'll switch gears to React Native. We'll port over
our existing application, shipping to iOS and Android. As a bonus,
we'll leave you with some guidance on deploying to iOS, Android, and
web at the same time

Happy hunting!
